    Abstract class for mapping index names to URLs.

    Implementations of this class must ensure asymptotic average-case time complexity of O(1) for all methods, i.e.
    for a large number of calls per second, the time taken to process each call should be constant on average.
    An inefficient implementation of this class can cause the Marqo client to be slow.

    The namespace of index names is with respect to a Client instance.
    Index names must be unique across all Marqo URLs referenced in the Mappings.
    If you want to support the same index name on different Marqo URLs, please use separate Client objects.
